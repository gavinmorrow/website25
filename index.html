      Hi, I'm Gavin! I enjoy programming, swimming, and theater tech. I also
      dabble in photography, urban planning/transportation, and linguistics.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm currently working on a
      <a href="https://github.com/gavinmorrow/qua-lang">compiler</a> and
      <a href="https://github.com/gavinmorrow/orion">browser extension</a>.
      Projects I've previously made that I'm proud of are a
      <a href="https://github.com/gavinmorrow/golem"
        >threaded messaging platform</a
      >,
      <a href="https://github.com/gavinmorrow/nd-tic-tac-toe"
        >n-dimensional tic-tac-toe</a
      >, and a simple
      <a href="https://github.com/gavinmorrow/iBudget"
        >accounting/bookkeeping app</a
      >. Oh and a
      <a href="https://github.com/gavinmorrow/logo-blocks"
        >mini-homemade-Scratch, but for the logo programming language</a
      >.

      Everything (text, code, buttons, photos) on this site made by me, without
      AI. The favicon for this site was made by a wonderful friend :]

      (btw, I'm still actively working on making this website. I haven't fully
      decided what I want to put here, so for now it's pretty empty.)
